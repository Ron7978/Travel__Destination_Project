    <h3><u><em>Details:</em></u></h3>

    <p>Paradise Island is connected to New Providence Island (Nassau) by two multi-lane bridges (one incoming, one outgoing). There's an entrance fee of $1 per vehicle.

        If you are coming in a rental car, the turnoff from East Bay Street to the Paradise Island bridge is clearly signed and you can't miss it. On the other hand, the turnoff from Paradise Island Drive to the return bridge is not clearly signed and is easy to miss until you're right on top of it.
        
        Parking on Paradise Island is very expensive. The main self-park option for Atlantis visitors not staying at Atlantis is the large parking garage to the east of Paradise Shopping Village. Most of that garage is reserved for Atlantis employees, but there is a block of spaces set aside for self-park non-Atlantis visitors which is accessible from Harbour Drive at the southwest corner of the garage. The problem is that as of 2015, it costs $9.67 to park there from zero to three hours (you will be charged that minimum amount even if you stay less than three hours) and it goes up ridiculously quickly from there. This is worth it only if you plan to spend three hours at Atlantis in the publicly accessible areas like the casino and Marina Village.
        
        There is also a self-park lot across the street from RIU on Casino Drive which costs only $5.00 per day. It is the most convenient option for visitors staying outside of Paradise Island who wish to reach the beach access trail next to RIU to visit Cabbage Beach.
        
        There is a large parking lot to the southwest of Atlantis, but it is reserved for Atlantis guests only and cannot be used by non-Atlantis guests to reach Paradise Beach.
        
        There is also a ferry from Paradise Island to the mainland. The schedule for the ferry is somewhat regular, but they try to wait until it is filled before departure.
